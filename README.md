# connections-app-ui
A sandbox desktop application to define data source connections from disparate sources

Even though this is public, it will probably not be of any use to the public, as it is just an experimental sandbox as I learn WPF.

**BUT**, with that said, if you want to offer tips and advise via issues or pull requests, feel free.   I'm in the "absorb all the informaiton" phase of this, so bring it on.
